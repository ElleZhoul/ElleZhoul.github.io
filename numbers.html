				<p>I used to think of my mind as a canvas. If I was wrong on a test, all I had to do was pick up the brush and paint over the old misconception, and that was it. Every belief was easy in, easy out. Over time, I’ve turned that old idea over and found it doesn’t have all that much depth. Sure, when I had the misconception that glass was actually a very viscous liquid that dripped downward over time, an offhanded comment saying otherwise was enough to let me know the reason windows in old houses were much thicker at the bottom was the difference in glassmaking standards in techniques when compared to today. I thought all thoughts were as easy to paint over, that if someone gave me enough evidence to convince me I was wrong I could just yank it out.</p>
				<p>I learned otherwise in a classroom. Now, the state of America’s education system is another story altogether, but despite the complete lack of efficiency at actually, well, teaching, forcing twenty-something children into close proximity and giving them the chance to talk to each other does at least give them an opportunity to learn from each other.</p>
				<p>So there I was, letting my mind wander as the teacher began to guide us into group discussions about a book I only had blurred recollections of, having read it years before and foolishly thought sufficient preparation. The air was hot and stuffy, I had sweat trailing down my back, and I’d gotten up at four in the morning. So I went last in our little group, and talked about a subject I thought was settled so I wouldn’t have to think.</p>
				<p>“Well, the book talks about how there are certain groups who have less and are treated poorly because of their eye color, which is clearly a parallel to slavery. It’s also set in a more medieval kind of society, so it’s talking about how in the past people were discriminated against because of really stupid things. So even though that doesn’t happen anymore, we have to, you know, be careful to judge people on who they are instead of things like how they look,” I said.</p>
				<p>Now, here’s something that might put the utter ignorance I’d just displayed in context. My group was one of the more diverse in the class; we had one guy who’d been born in India and immigrated just before the start of the year, two black girls, and me. And the thing is, no one directly confronted me over this. A few sideways glances were exchanged, but everyone was willing to gloss over my gross lack of tact and move on. I wasn’t quite able to get what it was about, however, so when I noticed this sudden tension and questioned it, I got an answer.</p>
				<p>“Well,” Sandra said, picking over her words with care, “racism does still happen. Some people don’t like to talk about it much, but we kind of … get taught how to behave. Otherwise, there can be a risk of certain things happening.”</p>
				<p>With the weight of the day pressing down on me, I was more than willing to dismiss this as some people being, for lack of another way to put it, dicks, and that while some people were still old and racist and might shout slurs at people, everyone knew they were bad and wrong and overall, we lived in a progressive country where people were treated equally under the law and the actions of a few just didn’t matter all that much. But there was a flicker of doubt in my mind. It mostly had to do with the way Sandra had spoken. It had been oh so very careful, so polite, she had phrased everything in such an inoffensive manner, as if there was a real fear of me reacting like the racist dicks you see on TV every so often. Like if she said a word out of place I would descend into a cartoonish caricature and start shouting at her. It bothered me, that I was being handled with such a delicate touch.</p>
				<p>I went home, to a predominantly white neighborhood that, I found with a quick search, was known as a sundown town. As in, if a black driver came in after dark, police were nearly twice as ready to pull them over, and likely to shoot them dead if the driver made a ‘suspicious’ move. Okay, I thought, so there are racist police officers. But that didn’t necessarily mean the law itself was broken. Or did it? Were people really treated differently? How so? Why wasn’t it fixed yet?</p>
				<p>The answers I found were discouraging. Sure, the laws themselves were aggressively neutral in their wording, but their effects heavily targeted certain groups, and they all relied on the neutrality of the people enforcing them. Requiring certain ID checks made it harder for poorer people to vote, and since wealth is mostly passed down through families, groups disadvantaged in the past are often still poor in the present. Courts will give harsher punishments toward black people for the same crimes as white people, the lack of free contraception and the restriction of abortions are less about protecting babies and more about forcing women to give birth, especially with the utter lack of support given to the ones that grow up.</p>
				<p>In hindsight, my ignorance stemmed from a kind of faith. A faith that I lived in a nation with people at the top that tried their best to help, that the systems in place were put there with good intentions, that if problems existed structurally they were either because of a lack of understanding or a few bad actors. Finding out that wasn’t the case, it hurt. It’s a sharp, jagged thing, the fragments of your broken faith; in a god, a nation, a person. This nation isn’t great, and the more I looked into specific parts of history, the more I found it never had been. Donald Trump is not an anomaly, corruption is not a rarity, and more concentrated power always leads to more disparity.</p>
				<p>This realization was not a lightbulb moment. It was not fast, it was not easy. My mind felt less like a canvas, and more like a building, a house or a castle. A part of the very foundation was rotten, and now the entire structure was teetering. I pulled up splintered beliefs that rested on a lie over the course of several agonizing months, and when I was done I felt hollow. I lingered for a while, but that state of shock didn’t last forever. It couldn’t, not when I wasn’t the one affected by these oppressive structures. In this American hierarchy that tries to be as invisible as it can, I am at the top. And those who aren’t, they hurt more, see the system bearing down on them and have no choice but to hold it up every day. They don’t get to wallow in this sea of nihilism I rested in; all they can do is grit their teeth, put on a false grin, and bear it.</p>
				<p>I returned to school the next day with a quest. “Hey, Sandra. I thought about what you said, back then, and I was wondering … would you mind telling me more?”</p>
				<p>Whatever the way forward was, I had to start by learning from those who were actively affected, who knew what they were going through firsthand and could tell me which actions could help.</p>
