				<p>That voice, it was familiar, had spoken to her and alleviated long stretches of emptiness. She remembered words of family and culture and people, orbiting around each other with wit and charm. It had told her about the cities and villages and people that were worth protecting, about her own place as Britain’s valiant defender against the wicked French and their own cruel dragons. Outside was treasure and glory and life and light and she wanted to see it all. She redoubled her efforts, clawing and shoving at the edges of her world until something cracked.</p>
				<p>“Oh! Welcome to the world, little one!” It was the same voice, smooth and warm. It drifted through her mind, sparking memories from when she was smaller and could swim idly about.</p>
				<p>She crawled from the remains of her egg, blinking up at the strange blurry figures standing above her. One was standing back, still and silent. The other, the other she knew. He was perfect, and she spent a moment marveling that she could finally see him before her stomach growled at her.</p>
				<p>“You have food, right?” she said, stumbling over the words a bit before she figured out how to place her tongue, how to move her mouth, memorizing and internalizing a million little corrections. “You did say I would have something to eat when I got out, and now that I am I think I should have one of those cows you’ve said so much about.”</p>
				<p>“Certainly, although I’m afraid we must put that off a little longer,” he said, a hint of apology in his voice as he held up an arrangement of leather straps and buckles. “If you’ll allow me, I’ll have this on in but a moment, and we can bring in some nice beef for you.”</p>
				<p>“Very well then, put it on,” she said, shrugging her wings to either side to dry them out as she waited. She was still sticky from her time inside the egg, and now the soft leathery appendages were starting to prickle in discomfort.</p>
				<p>He approached, but put the harness down to the side and wetted a cloth in a nearby bucket, slowly removing the glistening slime that came with hatching as he rubbed over her neck, her wings, her back. Her eyes drooped, and she let out a low growl of satisfaction.</p>
				<p>“Good lord, did it just purr?”</p>
				<p>She looked past the two big figures, which had grown considerably less blurry in the time since her hatching, and spotted a couple of smaller ones peering in through the entrance to the warm, steamy room. Her human ignored the disruption, but the other turned to shoo them away, scolding them as they went.</p>
				<p>“But what breed is it, do you know? I’ve never seen one in those colors before,” one said. He smelled chalky and stiff, but most of all excited.</p>
				<p>“Shame on you, Dawson. There are illustrations aplenty in your books. I’ll be recommending some extra reading for your schoolmaster, on top of what you get for sneaking in like this. Come now, no more questions, get.”</p>
				<p>They left, and she raised her head, twisting it to catch sight of her human. “Why did that man make those others leave? That was a good question, I think, as I have heard very much of different breeds but not much of what they mean, or which one I am.”</p>
				<p>He chuckled, pausing in his task to wipe at his brow. “You’d be a Bright Copper, little one. When you’re all grown, you’ll be able to fly much higher and longer than any other breed you’ll be likely to encounter. You look almost like a sunrise even right out of the shell, which is a dead giveaway.”</p>
				<p>She accepted the answer, waiting a moment before posing her next question. “I should also like to know your name. It is most frustrating to know so much about you and yet not know what you are called. I do wish you’d told me while I was in the egg, but if you tell me now you can rectify that mistake quite handily.”</p>
				<p>“I am Cole, Cole Hanson. As it happens, I did tell you once before, but I suppose you were too young to remember at the time.”</p>
				<p>He put aside the cloth and reached for the discarded harness, which he held up while urging her to move certain limbs as he directed, sliding it over her with quick, efficient movements. She glanced down after it was in place and decided she quite liked the little silvery buckles, standing out bright and shiny against her scales.</p>
				<p>“There! Does it fit? Anything chafing?”</p>
				<p>She bent and twisted about, then shook her head before saying, “Cole, do I have a name?”</p>
				<p>Cole smiled. “Not currently, no. Would you like me to give you one?”</p>
				<p>Of course she did! She was just opening her mouth to say so when a horn wailed out, digging into her ears, making her flinch back and Cole stare outside in concern.</p>
				<p>“Pray, do not go anywhere, little one. I’ll return presently.” He put a hand on a thin but shiny sword attached to his waist and ran off.</p>
				<p>It was the first time he lied to her, and the last time she heard his voice.</p>
				<p></p>
				<hr>
				<p>They found her hours later, the French successfully repelled, and four of the enemy dragons dead in the engagement—and with them, her Cole. She came to understand many things, then. Victory, a word that tasted so bright and sweet in cloudy memories, now felt flat and dead. There was a ceremony, where they boasted of his bravery, his honor. She crept over to his grave one night and heard his silence when she asked how honor mattered. Another aviator, still selfishly alive, found her in the morning with a panicked flush to his face and took her back to the training ground where she lived now, placing a chain around her neck, “for safety.” He then took it upon himself to find her every morning since, oh so graciously feeding her as she was not allowed to go and get a cow herself, and talk over her stony silence, imagining her responses in his grand speeches.</p>
				<p>“Are you entirely sure? If you do not choose a captain, then you will not be able to fight.”</p>
				<p>She turned away from him. Neat clothes and shiny buttons would not persuade her. She curled up against herself, shutting her eyes and picturing herself floating in a world of black and dull reds, letting memories wash over her, imagining a voice that was already starting to fade at the edges. None other could compare. She would not let them.</p>
				<p>He interrupted, “Solis—”</p>
				<p>She hissed, lunging forward and snapping her jaws closed inches from his face. He had offered her a name when he found she was without one, but Cole had not, and so she would do without. Yet he insisted on calling her Solis, as if he could wear her down into accepting it, accepting him, when she had said she would not.</p>
				<p>He blinked, but did not back down or otherwise react. “You cannot fight without a captain, and if you will not fight, then the only alternative is Pen y Fan.”</p>
				<p>She let his words linger in the air, refraining from contesting them with a great effort. The breeding grounds were not an option. They said it was either that or fighting, a choice enforced by those she had no intention of allowing to dictate what she would or would not do. But if they did not think her compliant, she was sure there would be more than the single dark chain attached to her harness, her mind conjuring images of thick layers of rope and suffocating coils of metal. That, she would not allow to happen. Cole had told her of her breed’s aptitude for long flights. As long as she was grown large enough and had enough of a head start, there would be no chance of another dragon catching her.</p>
				<p>So she waited. Day by day, sometimes giving small signs that she might settle for one aviator or another as captain, though it pained her to do so. She grew larger, the chain creaking when she tested it, and her harness was replaced with a larger one, the original kept beside her at all times. A few of the men she even allowed to ride on her back so they would let her practice her flight, and she discovered she could glide for much longer without flapping than any other dragon. But as more time went by, the aviators’ suspicions became apparent. Her portions of meat stopped growing with her, and every request for more was stalled with an array of excuses. They replaced her chain with one twice as thick and would not say why. Every new affront was accompanied by a man telling her how much better everything would be if she went to the breeding grounds, or if she took a captain.</p>
				<p>It all culminated in her first harness being taken during the night, and it was not returned until she threatened to kill and eat the next person she saw. She was not done growing at that point, but she had grown tired of tolerating these offenses. As soon as night fell and the grounds were cleared, she tore off her newest harness, leaving it in scraps on the ground with the chain still attached to it. The one Cole had given her she kept in her claws as she went off to the cow pens, where she gorged herself on two of the animals before leaping into the sky and heading to sea, the wind whipping at her narrowed eyes as she thought.</p>
				<p>Britain, or at least the small drizzly corner she inhabited, lacked that golden sheen Cole’s voice had given it in her memories. There was glory to be had, but always at the point of a sword or the barrel of a gun. For Cole, it had been a choice to become an aviator and fight the French—a choice which, having caused his death, she viewed very dimly indeed. Whatever the motivations of the two nations, they seemed to only involve her and other dragons by proxy. Perhaps she could spend her life in the wilderness, butchering whatever animals she could find and rushing away whenever she caught a hint of man’s presence. She could make herself more trouble than she was worth for whoever they would send after her, fleeing civilization wherever it went and ultimately changing nothing.</p>
				<p>Or, she might find these breeding grounds that pitiful attempt of a replacement for Cole had threatened her with. If Pen Y Fan held every dragon unwilling to take a captain, forced into one place and left with their thoughts, might she be able to stir some of them into action?</p>
